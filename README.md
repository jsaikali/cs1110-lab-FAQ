### What is section for?  
Section is a structured time for you to work on the lab that was released the day before. The advantages of coming to lab is that you have TAs and Consultants at your disposal to ask questions as they come up.  

### Is attendance mandatory?  
Not always, but **you will need to attend lab on days where there are manual questions** for the lab due on that day. So if Lab X is due today, and there are manual questions on that Lab X, you will need to attend today to discuss your responses. A staff member will give you credit during lab.  

### So, if I am finished with the lab I'm supposed to be working on (due next time), can I leave?  
Sure! Have a great day.   

### Who are the lab staff members?   
Joanna is your Lab Instructor (TA), and your Consultants are:   
- Rachel, Ellie, Al for Section 206  
- Yunus, Chris, Ryan, Vianca for Section 218   
All staff members are happy to help you with your lab questions!  

### Who do I talk to about grading issues / extensions?  
Note that we do not give extensions freely, unless there truly is an extenuating circumstance. 
Only Joanna can grant extensions and handle grading issues. Joanna cannot grant extensions for Assignments - only for Labs. If you have a personal grading/extension question offline or during lab, be sure to discuss it with Joanna.     

### Do labs count towards my course grade?
Labs are not factored into your final score for the class, but if you miss more than 2 labs we reserve the right to dock your final letter grade for the course. That being said, I would definitely recommend doing all your labs, because they prepare you for the assignments which do count towards your grade!  

### Can I have a breakout room to discuss a question I have in private?  
Yes. But you have to add yourself to the "Lab Help" GoogleSheet (Joanna sends the link out in the Chat), so we can streamline the process. It is the same GoogleSheet each time, but I add a new tab to it just before lab, so feel free to bookmark it. **When you come back to the main room, let the TA in there know that you're back (so she can send someone else to that breakout room).**    

### What are "manual grade" modules?  
These are modules that are not graded by the autograder, because the questions ask for your thoughts/opinions. You will discuss your answers and get checked off in section on the day that the lab is due, so be sure to attend lab that day.  

### How do I get checked off for "manual grade" questions?  
At the beginning of section on the lab's due date, we will assign breakout rooms with a group of students + 1 staff member to discuss the lab. You do not need to add anything to the "Lab Help" sheet - everyone is automatically assigned to breakouts at the start of section. Send your NET ID to your breakout room so the staff member can check you off in the lab system. The module should be marked as COMPLETE by the time you leave section.    

### I was just in a breakout room but my lab still isn't checked off.
Make sure you refresh the page at the end of the breakout room to see if you have been checked off. Also note that the individual manual questions might say "NOT GRADED," but this is normal, as long as the whole module says "COMPLETE". If this is not the case, let Joanna know.  

### I did not know I was supposed to attend lab to get checked off for manual questions, what should I do?
If people are missing manual grade checks for labs 1-4 because not there, we are excusing it this ONE TIME ONLY, provided that there is an answer there. Let Joanna know that you need these items graded. For lab 5 onwards, we won't be retroactively checking off manual questions (you should know by now that you need to attend section).  

### I joined late and didn't get checked off for manual questions. What should I do?  
**If you are late you will wait.** I will check off latecomers when everyone else has gotten their lab questions answered, which may be at the very end of lab. Do **NOT** add yourself to the "Lab Help" googlesheet to get checked off - that is for actual lab-specific questions, not late check-offs. To alert Joanna that you have come late and need to get checked off, send a message in the chat to let her know, but do not expect to be checked off until other students' questions have been answered. She will grade your manual questions at the end along with other latecomers.  

### I have a question that didn't get answered in lab, what do I do?  
You can post on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/keahwsxwvhh25b) or go to [Office Hours](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs1110/2020fa/info/officehours/) to get your questions answered.
